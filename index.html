          In March&nbsp;2025, Mallinckrodt and Endo agreed to merge in a deal valued at nearly $7&nbsp;billion, combining two
          specialty drugmakers that had each emerged from Chapter&nbsp;11 processes linked to opioid-related liabilities.<sup> (Financial Times, Reuters)</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Financial Times and Reuters report that Endo shareholders were to receive $80&nbsp;million in cash and about 49.9% of
          the combined company, with Mallinckrodt investors owning approximately 50.1%. The new group was described as expecting
          roughly $3.6&nbsp;billion in 2025 revenue and planning a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.<sup> (FT, Reuters)</sup>

      <h2 class="section-title">Who these companies were before the merger</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Both Mallinckrodt and Endo had portfolios that combined branded therapies with significant exposure to generic opioids,
        and both carried heavy debt loads going into the opioid litigation wave.

        <div class="subsection-subtitle">Generic opioids, Acthar, and a global settlement framework</div>
        <p>
          Mallinckrodt plc, headquartered in Ireland, was a major manufacturer of generic opioid pain pills and branded products
          such as Acthar Gel. State attorneys general such as those in California and North Carolina describe Mallinckrodt as one
          of the largest generic opioid manufacturers in the U.S., and detail a 2020 global settlement framework under which the
          company agreed to contribute roughly $1.6&nbsp;billion in structured payments to an opioid abatement trust system.<sup> (CA &amp; NC AGs)</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Separately, the U.S. Department of Justice and several states brought actions over Medicaid rebates tied to Acthar,
          alleging that Mallinckrodt and its predecessor Questcor underpaid rebates by treating Acthar as if it had been newly
          approved in 2013 rather than decades earlier. Those cases resulted in substantial additional payments and civil
          penalties.<sup> (DOJ, state AG releases)</sup>

        <div class="subsection-subtitle">Opana ER, marketing conduct and restructuring pressure</div>
        <p>
          Endo International plc marketed opioids including Opana and Opana&nbsp;ER. Complaints such as the one filed by the
          Kentucky Attorney General allege that Endo downplayed addiction risks and overstated benefits, contributing to the
          opioid epidemic in that state.<sup> (Kentucky AG)</sup> The FDA later asked Endo to withdraw Opana&nbsp;ER from the market, and
          Endo complied.
        </p>
        <p>
          By August&nbsp;2022, Endo filed for Chapter&nbsp;11 with roughly $8&nbsp;billion of debt and extensive opioid-related exposure.<sup> (Reuters)</sup>
          A 2024 U.S. Department of Justice press release describes Endo Health Solutions being ordered to pay more than
          $1.5&nbsp;billion in criminal fines and forfeiture for distributing misbranded Opana&nbsp;ER, in addition to civil and bankruptcy
          resolutions funneled through the Endo Public Opioid Trust and related settlement structures.<sup> (DOJ, Endo Public Opioid Trust)</sup>

          <strong>Common themes.</strong><br />
          Both issuers used Chapter&nbsp;11 to corral large opioid claim pools into trust structures, reduce debt, and transfer
          significant equity stakes to lenders and settlement vehicles, while keeping operating pharmaceutical businesses intact.

      <div class="section-kicker">After the Deal</div>
      <h2 class="section-title">Keenova &amp; Par Health: two separate shapes</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Public materials and industry reporting describe a post-merger structure in which the combined group later separates
        into a branded therapeutics business and an independent generics/sterile injectables company.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-body">
      <div class="subsection">
        <div class="subsection-title">Keenova Therapeutics</div>
        <div class="subsection-subtitle">Branded specialty medicines</div>
        <p>
          Mallinckrodt’s site and coverage from Pharmaphorum report that after the merger closed on July&nbsp;31&nbsp;2025, the company
          rebranded the specialty therapeutics business as Keenova Therapeutics later in the year.<sup> (Mallinckrodt.com, Pharmaphorum)</sup>
          Keenova focuses on branded medicines such as Acthar Gel, Xiaflex and Terlivaz. Pharmaphorum and BioSpace state that
          Keenova has pro forma 2024 sales of roughly $1.7&nbsp;billion and around 1,600 employees, with plans for a New York Stock
          Exchange listing.<sup> (Pharmaphorum, BioSpace)</sup>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <div class="subsection-title">Par Health</div>
        <div class="subsection-subtitle">Generics, APIs and sterile injectables</div>
        <p>
          The same coverage describes Par Health as the independent generics, API and sterile injectables business spun out of
          the combined company. BioSpace and related releases indicate that Par Health records quarterly sales of roughly
          $337&nbsp;million, employs about 4,000 people, and operates a U.S.-advantaged manufacturing footprint.<sup> (BioSpace, Pharmaphorum)</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          The separation of Keenova and Par Health allows one entity to focus on branded, often higher-margin therapies and the
          other on volume-driven generics and contract manufacturing, while both sit alongside the pre-existing opioid trust
          structures.
