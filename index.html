            two specialty drugmakers that had each emerged from Chapter&nbsp;11 proceedings driven in large part by opioid-related

            expected about $3.6&nbsp;billion in 2025 revenue and a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.<sup> (FT, Reuters)</sup>

            Mallinckrodt plc, based in Ireland, was a major manufacturer of generic opioid pain pills and branded products
            such as Acthar Gel. It faced lawsuits from states, local governments and others alleging that its generics
            business helped fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic, and it also faced federal actions over Medicaid rebates on
            Acthar.<sup> (California &amp; North Carolina AGs, DOJ/AG releases, BioPharma Dive)</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Endo International plc, headquartered in the U.S., marketed opioids including Opana&nbsp;ER and faced state
            lawsuits and federal claims over its marketing and sale of opioids. The Department of Justice later described
            misconduct around the distribution of misbranded Opana&nbsp;ER and obtained large criminal fines and forfeiture
            from Endo Health Solutions in 2024.<sup> (DOJ, Kentucky AG, DOJ press release)</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Both companies carried significant debt and used Chapter&nbsp;11 as the forum to settle opioid and other claims, reset
            their capital structures and hand substantial equity to lenders and opioid trusts.

            Mallinckrodt’s corporate site and industry coverage describe a sequence in which the merged Mallinckrodt–Endo group
            later spun off its generics and sterile injectables unit as Par Health and rebranded the remaining specialty
            therapeutics business as Keenova Therapeutics in late 2025.<sup> (Mallinckrodt.com, Pharmaphorum, BioSpace)</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Pharmaphorum and BioSpace report that Keenova focuses on branded medicines such as Acthar Gel, Xiaflex and Terlivaz,
            with roughly $1.7&nbsp;billion in pro forma 2024 sales and around 1,600 employees, while Par Health is an
            independent generics, API and sterile injectables company with quarterly sales of about $337&nbsp;million and roughly
            4,000 employees.<sup> (Pharmaphorum, BioSpace)</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            The strategic idea, as described in this coverage, is to separate a more research- and brand-driven business from a
            volume-oriented generics platform, each with its own governance and potential investor base.

        <strong>Opioid settlements as a backdrop.</strong><br />
        State attorneys general summarize Mallinckrodt’s agreement to contribute roughly $1.6–1.725&nbsp;billion over several
        years into opioid trusts, and Endo’s agreement to pay hundreds of millions of dollars into the Endo Public Opioid
        Trust and related settlements, alongside federal criminal fines and forfeiture for misbranding Opana&nbsp;ER.<sup> (CA &amp; NC AGs, Endo Public Opioid Trust, DOJ)</sup>

        <strong>Deal-driven “fresh starts.”</strong><br />
        Financial Times and Reuters both frame the 2025 merger as a way for two opioid-burdened issuers to grow scale and
        reposition their portfolios after restructuring, even as the trust structures and settlement obligations remain in
        place around the new companies.<sup> (FT, Reuters)</sup>
