          </ul>
          <p>
            Several state attorneys general describe Mallinckrodt as a major manufacturer of generic opioid pills that were
            widely distributed in the U.S. A 2020 global settlement framework announced by state AGs such as California and
            North Carolina states that Mallinckrodt agreed to pay about $1.6&nbsp;billion in structured cash payments into a trust
            to fund opioid abatement efforts by states, local governments and tribes.<sup> (CA &amp; NC AGs)</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            The California Attorney General later summarizes the bankruptcy plan as requiring Mallinckrodt to pay approximately
            $1.725&nbsp;billion over eight years into a trust system for public and private opioid creditors, starting with a
            $450&nbsp;million payment in June&nbsp;2022.<sup> (CA AG)</sup> The Mallinckrodt Opioid Master Disbursement Trust&nbsp;II (MDT&nbsp;II) website
            describes MDT&nbsp;II as a “hub” trust that receives settlement funds and allocates them to a series of sub-trusts for
            different creditor groups (states, tribes, hospitals, individuals).<sup> (MDT&nbsp;II)</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Reporting from the Washington Post and Reuters notes that when Mallinckrodt returned to Chapter&nbsp;11 in 2023, the
            company and MDT&nbsp;II negotiated a revised deal in which Mallinckrodt would make a one-time $250&nbsp;million payment and
            eliminate nearly $1&nbsp;billion of remaining opioid settlement obligations, while also reducing other debt by roughly
            $2&nbsp;billion.<sup> (Washington Post, Reuters, MDT&nbsp;II)</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Separately, the U.S. Department of Justice and several state AGs pursued Mallinckrodt over Medicaid rebates tied to
            Acthar Gel, a non-opioid product. DOJ and state releases explain that Mallinckrodt and its predecessor Questcor
            allegedly underpaid rebates by treating Acthar as if it were a “new drug” in 2013 rather than a product originally
            approved decades earlier, resulting in large additional payments and civil penalties.<sup> (DOJ, WA &amp; NJ AGs)</sup>

          </ul>
          <p>
            State complaints such as the one filed by the Kentucky Attorney General allege that Endo developed, marketed and
            sold opioids including Opana and Opana&nbsp;ER while downplaying addiction risks and overstating benefits, contributing
            to the opioid epidemic in those jurisdictions.<sup> (Kentucky AG)</sup> In 2017, the FDA asked Endo to withdraw Opana&nbsp;ER from
            the market, and Endo complied.<sup> (FDA references in AG filings)</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that Endo Health Solutions was ordered to pay more than
            $1.5&nbsp;billion in criminal fines and forfeiture for distributing misbranded Opana&nbsp;ER, describing this as one of the
            largest criminal financial penalties ever imposed on a pharmaceutical company.<sup> (DOJ)</sup> In parallel, a bankruptcy
            settlement provided that Endo would pay roughly $465&nbsp;million to resolve criminal and civil claims with the U.S.
            government and about $450&nbsp;million to state and municipal opioid trusts, as summarized by the Financial Times and
            other coverage.<sup> (FT, Reuters, Law360 summaries)</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Endo’s confirmed Chapter&nbsp;11 plan, as described by Reuters and by state AG materials, dedicates around $600&nbsp;million
            to opioid and tax-related settlements and creates the Endo Public Opioid Trust for state-level abatement payments,
            while transferring more than 95% of the reorganized equity to Endo’s secured lenders.<sup> (Reuters, CA AG, Endo Public Opioid Trust)</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Endo Public Opioid Trust site explains that the trust’s beneficiaries are U.S. states, the District of Columbia
            and certain territories, and that the trustee is responsible for administering distributions in line with the Endo
            plan and trust agreement.<sup> (Endo Public Opioid Trust)</sup>

      </div>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Financial Times and other outlets explicitly link the merger to the two companies’ opioid-era liabilities and their use
        of Chapter&nbsp;11 to resolve them.

          A March&nbsp;2025 article in the Financial Times describes Mallinckrodt and Endo as drugmakers “emerging from bankruptcy
          processes linked to liabilities over the US opioid crisis,” noting that both companies had resolved billions of
          dollars in claims related to their distribution of addictive generic opioid painkillers before agreeing to combine in
          a nearly $7&nbsp;billion transaction.<sup> (FT)</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the FT report, Mallinckrodt paid about $700&nbsp;million in 2023 to settle lawsuits related to its generic
          oxycodone products, while Endo agreed to pay $465&nbsp;million to the U.S. government and $450&nbsp;million to state and
          municipal trusts, and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor over its opioid marketing practices, with additional obligations
          flowing through its bankruptcy plan and the Endo Public Opioid Trust.<sup> (FT)</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          The article groups Mallinckrodt and Endo with Purdue Pharma as examples of drugmakers that used Chapter&nbsp;11 to settle
          opioid claims and continue operating. The restructuring architecture puts opioid claimants into trust vehicles while
          leaving restructured operating businesses — now branded Keenova and Par Health — to focus on ongoing pharmaceutical
          manufacturing and development.

            <strong>Operational vs. legacy liability.</strong><br />
            Post-restructuring, Keenova and Par Health are presented in public materials as going-concern operating companies,
            while large parts of the opioid liability streams are channeled into MDT&nbsp;II and the Endo Public Opioid Trust,
            funded over time under the bankruptcy plans.

            <strong>Persistent reputational risk.</strong><br />
            Even with the legal structures in place, financial press coverage highlights ongoing scrutiny of how Chapter&nbsp;11
            has been used by opioid manufacturers and how stakeholders perceive the balance between victim compensation and
            corporate survival.
