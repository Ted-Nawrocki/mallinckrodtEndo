        This page concentrates on the opioid-related allegations, settlements and trust structures that sit behind the

        <ul class="pill-list">
          <li>Large generic opioid manufacturer</li>
          <li>Global abatement settlement</li>
          <li>MDT&nbsp;II “hub” trust</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          State attorneys general, including those in California and North Carolina, describe Mallinckrodt as one of the largest
          generic opioid manufacturers in the U.S. They outline a settlement framework under which Mallinckrodt agreed to pay
          roughly $1.6–1.725&nbsp;billion in structured cash payments into opioid abatement trusts for states, local governments,
          tribes and private claimants, with an initial $450&nbsp;million payment in June&nbsp;2022.<sup> (CA &amp; NC AGs)</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mallinckrodt Opioid Master Disbursement Trust&nbsp;II (MDT&nbsp;II) website explains that MDT&nbsp;II acts as a “hub” trust that
          receives settlement funds from Mallinckrodt and allocates them to several public and private creditor trusts for
          different classes of opioid-related claimants.<sup> (MDT&nbsp;II)</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          When Mallinckrodt returned to Chapter&nbsp;11 in 2023, reporting from the Washington Post and Reuters notes that the
          company and MDT&nbsp;II negotiated a revised deal that cut nearly $1&nbsp;billion from the remaining opioid obligations and
          reduced other debt by about $2&nbsp;billion, in exchange for a one-time $250&nbsp;million payment and other consideration,
          while cancelling existing equity.<sup> (Washington Post, Reuters, MDT&nbsp;II)</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          In parallel, the U.S. Department of Justice and state AGs pursued Mallinckrodt and its predecessor Questcor over
          Medicaid rebates for Acthar Gel. DOJ and state releases allege that the company underpaid rebates by treating Acthar
          as a “new drug” in 2013 rather than an older product, resulting in additional payments and civil penalties on top of
          the opioid settlements.<sup> (DOJ, WA &amp; NJ AGs)</sup>

          <li>Endo Public Opioid Trust</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Kentucky Attorney General’s complaint and other state filings allege that Endo developed, marketed and sold opioids
          including Opana and Opana&nbsp;ER in ways that understated addiction risks and overstated benefits, contributing to the
          opioid crisis in those jurisdictions.<sup> (Kentucky AG)</sup> In 2017 the FDA asked Endo to withdraw Opana&nbsp;ER from the
          market, and Endo did so.
        </p>
        <p>
          In May&nbsp;2024, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that Endo Health Solutions was ordered to pay more than
          $1.5&nbsp;billion in criminal fines and forfeiture related to misbranded Opana&nbsp;ER, calling it one of the largest criminal
          financial penalties ever imposed on a pharmaceutical company.<sup> (DOJ)</sup> DOJ and related materials describe these
          penalties as part of a broader package that includes civil settlements and bankruptcy plan obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reuters and state AG materials explain that Endo’s confirmed Chapter&nbsp;11 plan dedicates around $600&nbsp;million to opioid
          and tax-related settlements, with hundreds of millions flowing through the Endo Public Opioid Trust, while more than
          95% of the reorganized equity is transferred to the company’s lenders.<sup> (Reuters, CA AG, Endo Public Opioid Trust)</sup> The
          Endo Public Opioid Trust’s official site states that its beneficiaries are U.S. states, the District of Columbia and
          certain territories, and describes the trustee’s role in administering distributions under the plan.<sup> (Endo Public Opioid Trust)</sup>

          <strong>Trusts instead of direct corporate payments.</strong><br />
          Both MDT&nbsp;II and the Endo Public Opioid Trust are separate vehicles created under bankruptcy plans to receive and
          distribute opioid settlement payments over time, rather than having the operating companies make ad hoc payments
          directly to individual plaintiffs and governments.

      <div class="section-kicker">Combined Story</div>
      <h2 class="section-title">How the litigation sets the stage for the merger</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="section-body">
      <p>
        A March&nbsp;2025 article in the Financial Times describes Mallinckrodt and Endo as drugmakers “emerging from bankruptcy
        processes linked to liabilities over the US opioid crisis” and notes that both resolved billions of dollars in opioid
        claims before agreeing to combine in a nearly $7&nbsp;billion transaction.<sup> (FT)</sup> The article cites Mallinckrodt’s payments
        into MDT&nbsp;II and Endo’s commitments to federal and state settlements, including a $465&nbsp;million payment to the U.S.
        government and $450&nbsp;million to state and municipal trusts, alongside the DOJ’s criminal case.
      </p>
      <p>
        The combined picture is a capital structure in which opioid claimants are represented via trust vehicles with defined
        funding schedules, while the reorganized operating companies — now presented as Keenova and Par Health — are positioned
        as going-concern pharmaceutical businesses with a mix of branded and generic portfolios.
      </p>
      <p>
        Financial press coverage groups Mallinckrodt and Endo with Purdue Pharma as examples of opioid manufacturers using
        Chapter&nbsp;11 to resolve mass-tort liabilities and continue operations. That framing highlights an ongoing policy debate
        over how bankruptcy is used to address public health harms, even as investors and counterparties evaluate Keenova and
        Par Health on more conventional pharmaceutical metrics.
